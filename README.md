# Jenny Dinh 
...or call me _**thatjenster**_ <br>
**I'm currently looking for work! Let's [chat](https://calendly.com/thatjenster)** 🤗

<img width="100%" src="https://thatjenster.github.io/thatjenster/githubProfileTop.gif">

I am a professional Front-End Web Developer based in Toronto, originally from Vancouver. I have a passion for creating beautiful web applications. <br>

When I am not 👩‍💻 , you can find me exploring the 🌎 and looking for the next best 🍣 joint!

## How I work
Continuously Learning via the [改善](https://thatjenster.wordpress.com/2020/05/31/how-kaizen-is-making-me-a-better-developer/)  way. <br>
Striving to be the best version of me and inspiring others to do the same. <br>
I'm either [hustling](https://thatjenster.wordpress.com/2020/06/29/i-aint-great-but-i-got-grit-how-i-overcome-selfdoubt-as-a-developer/) early mornings or late nights... but never both. Rest and Recovery is important for [long-term goals](https://thatjenster.wordpress.com/2020/05/19/coding-the-invisible-superpower-in-an-evolving-world/). 💯
